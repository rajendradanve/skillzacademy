This passion started at 12-years-old when I taught myself how to make Windows batch scripts. Little did I know that hacking around on my computer back then would turn into a life-long passion for programming. I went on to complete a degree in Computer Systems Networking at Nottingham Trent University, and worked in various developer roles at multinational corporations and startups. I always believed that the final step to learning is teaching. And so I started a software development blog and consultancy firm called London App Developer. My work has been featured in the Daily Mail, Mashable, TechCrunch, the Huffington Post, the Mirror and Gizmodo, and over 30,000 developers read my programming tutorials every month. My specialities are Python, Django, JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3, but because I&rsquo;m full-stack, I can work my way around most programming languages and frameworks.</p>",
